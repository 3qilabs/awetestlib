Netbeans IDE Setup
=======
------------
<br>
1. If you ran the `awetestlib netbeans_setup` command, you should now have a folder called "sample_netbeans" in the directory you ran the command in. Open Netbeans and go to Open Project.

2. Select the "sample_netbeans" folder that was created and click "Open Project". Your project is now loaded into Netbeans.
NOTE: Depending on the version of Netbeans you have, you may need to install the Ruby and Rails plugin.

3. You can view the different configurations from the config dropdown. We have provided a sample "Demo" config which runs the demo.rb script. To create your own, go to "Customize..."

<br>
4. In the configuration window, you can see the arguments for the Demo configuration. To create your own, go to "New". All the arguments (Main Script, Arguments, and Ruby Options) would be the same as the Demo configuration, the only difference would be the path to the script you want to run.

5. Once you have the script configurations set, you can select the config you want to run from the dropdown and hit the Play button. The script will now start to run within the IDE.
