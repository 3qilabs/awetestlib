Awetestlib
==========

Automate testing of browser-based applications in Windows, OSX, iOS, or Android

## Note: Awetestlib is undergoing significant changes and this document is very much a work in progress.
1. Support for cucumber and calabash is removed to keep things focused
2. Support for classic Watir is removed.  Watir-Webdriver and Selenium IE support are much improved since Awetestlib was first written.
3. Native and hybrid mobile applications are not supported.  Browser based apps only.
4. The legacy awetestlib dsl is being phased out.
5. The new dsl is both simplified and expanded. Code readability and consistency is the primary aim.
6. The gem will be heavily documented using Yard conventions so look for the current deployed version in rubygems and rubydoc.info


------------
## Prerequisites: Ruby 2.0.x and RubyInstaller Devkit (Windows) or Xcode (Mac)

### Windows
#### Ruby 2.0.x
You need to have Ruby 2.0.x installed using the RubyInstaller package.

You can download the RubyInstaller for 2.0.x
[here](http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/).  Choose the most recent 2.0.x.

**Install in a directory without spaces, like C:\Ruby187. Don't install in Program Files.**

**Make sure you tell the installer to put Ruby in the PATH environment variable.**

You can check your Ruby version using:

    ruby -v


#### RubyInstaller Devkit (Windows only)
Additionally, for Windows, you will need to install the RubyInstaller DevKit to compile a few dependent gems.

Download DevKit
[from here](http://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/)
and the installation directions can also be found
[here](https://github.com/oneclick/rubyinstaller/wiki/Development-Kit).

Choose the one for Ruby 2.0.x and your Windows word size (32 or 64 bit) and download the package.

Create directory C:\devkit and unzip the devkit package into that directory.

Open a command window and change to C:\devkit.

Then execute

	ruby dk.rb init

And do

	ruby dk.rb review 

And make sure you see C:\Ruby20x at the end of the output.  Now

	ruby dk.rb install

If you have difficulties with the above in Windows 7 and/or behind a firewall, you may have to set the http_proxy and/or run the installers as administrator. (see below)

### OSX
#### Ruby
Ruby 1.8.7 is installed by default in OSX. You will have to update to 2.0.x

#### Xcode
Follow Mac instructions for installing/upgrading Xcode to latest version.

## Install Awetestlib

**Start** by opening a command window or terminal.

----------

#### NOTE: If you are behind a firewall:

1. You will need to set the http_proxy environment variable
2. You _may_ have to change the HOMEDRIVE environment variable to C: in Windows
3. You may need to run the Windows 7 command window as administrator.

In Windows

	set http_proxy=http://myproxy.mycompany.com:80
	set HOMEDRIVE=C:

In OSX

	export HTTP_PROXY=http://myproxy.mycompany.com:80


----------
#### Temporary but necessary (13may2013)

In the command window:

	gem install nokogiri -v 1.5.9 --no-ri --no-rdoc

And

	gem install mini_magick -v 3.5.0 --no-ri --no-rdoc

**Then**, in the command window, install the awetestlib gem.

Note: This could take up to 5 minutes for first time installs.  You may need to use 'sudo' on OSX

    gem install awetestlib --no-ri --no-rdoc

**Then** run the following command and verify the step

    awetestlib regression_setup

### Usage

Run the following command to see the different usages

    awetestlib
    
## Mobile
### Appium (both Windows and OSX)
#### Android
##### Emulator (Windows only)
##### Device
#### iOs
##### Simulator (OSX only)
##### Device

## Setup Browsers
### Safari (OSX only)
To setup support for Safari browser, download the Selenium Safari Standalone Server from [Selenium downloads](https://code.google.com/p/selenium/downloads/list).  
Select selenium-server-standalone-x.xx.xx.jar.  (The version is 2.33.0 as of this writing.)  Download it and copy it into /Library/Java/Extensions.
You will need to start this process in a terminal session before running Safari scripts, else you will get a 'waiting for connection' error. 
Start it with this command in a terminal session:

	  nohup java -jar /Library/Java/Extensions/selenium-server-standalone-2.33.0.jar & 

When using raw Watir-webdriver for Safari, open the browser with

    browser = Watir::Browser.new(:remote, :desired_capabilities=>:'safari')

A Caveat: The Selenium SafariDriver currently cannot handle modal alerts/windows, except to dismiss them (invisibly) whenever they exist. ([Issue 3862](https://code.google.com/p/selenium/issues/detail?id=3862))  
This means that any modal, expected or not, will not be visible when the selenium-server-standalone is running.  Expected alerts ('Are you sure?') also do not appear, even when manually clicking link or button that should produce alert. 

### Firefox

Firefox support is built into the selenium-webdriver gem (required by the watir-webdriver gem) for both Windows and OSX.  

### Chrome
To setup support for Google Chrome browser, please download the latest Chromedriver version for your platform from [here](http://code.google.com/p/chromedriver/downloads/list)

Then move the executables into your PATH. To find your PATH, type the command below in your terminal/command prompt:

For OSX:

    echo $PATH

For Windows:

    PATH

### Internet Explorer (Windows only)
To setup support for Internet Explorer, please download the latest IEDriverServer version from [here](http://code.google.com/p/selenium/downloads/list)
and move the executable into your PATH.

We suggest putting the Chrome and IE drivers in C:\Ruby187\bin (in Windows) as it should already be in your path.

## Setup IDEs (Rubymine, Netbeans)

To setup the awetestlib gem with Rubymine use:

    awetestlib rubymine_setup <ProjectName>

To setup awetestlib with Netbeans use:

    awetestlib netbeans_setup <ProjectName>

You can now start your scripts within the IDE. Follow the instructions in each IDE for creating and executing run/debug configurations.

For additional information on IDE setup, refer to the links below:

  - [Netbeans IDE setup](https://github.com/3qilabs/awetestlib/blob/develop/netbeans_setup.md)

  - [Rubymine IDE setup](https://github.com/3qilabs/awetestlib/blob/develop/rubymine_setup.md)

## Command Line Execution
If you prefer to run your tests from command line, you can use the following command

  `awetestlib <script_file> [options]`

  For example: To run a script named demo.rb in Firefox, your command will look like:

  `awetestlib demo.rb -b FF`

Here is the full list of the currently available command line options:

    Usage: awetestlib <script_file> [options]
        -b, --browser BROWSER            Specify a browser (IE, FF, S, C)
        -r, --root_path ROOT_PATH        Specify the root path (default is current path)
        -l, --library LIBRARY            Specify a library to be loaded
        -x, --excel EXCEL_FILE           Specify an excel file containing variables to be loaded
        -v, --version VERSION            Specify a browser version
        -e, --environment_url URL        Specify the environment URL
        -f, --environment_nodename NODE  Specify the environment node name
        -n, --environment_name NAME      Specify the environment name
        -u, --selenium_remote_url URL    Specify the device's remote url and port
        -s, --screencap_path PATH        Specify the path where screenshots will be saved
        -o, --output_to_log              Write to log file
            --log_path_subdir SUBDIR     Specify log path relative to root_path. Defaults to (root_path)/log if -o is specified.
		-p, --pry						 Require Pry for debugging
		-c, --classic_watir				 Use Classic Watir for IE instead of Watir-webdriver
            --report_all_test_refs       Include list of all error/test case reference ids actually validated

To start writing your own script, refer to the [Scripting Guide/Wiki](https://github.com/3qilabs/awetestlib/wiki/Getting-Started---Scripting) wiki.

For the latest documentation of the Awetest DSL go to [Rubydoc](http://rubydoc.info/gems/awetestlib) and look in Awetestlib::Regression.

### Cucumber Support

One of the technologies that the Awetest framework supports is [Cucumber](http://cukes.info/). To get setup with cucumber, you can run the following command:

`awetestlib cucumber_setup <ProjectName>`

That will create the standard cucumber folder structure in the ProjectName directory.

Visit our [wiki](https://github.com/3qilabs/awetestlib/wiki/Predefined-Cucumber-Web-Steps) to see the list of predefined steps provided by awetestlib.
